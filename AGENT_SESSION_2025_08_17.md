# Agent Build Session — 2025-08-17

This document logs the implementation of ForumGram v1 per `SPEC.md`.

- Repo initialized as a Vite + React + TypeScript PWA targeting desktop web.
- Core libraries wired: Zustand (state), React Query (server-state), Dexie (IndexedDB), FlexSearch (worker), GramJS (Telegram MTProto), Markdown/KaTeX rendering, Virtuoso virtualization, Workbox via Vite PWA.
- Node polyfills enabled for browser GramJS.

## Project Structure

- `src/app`: App bootstrap, routing, layout
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components
- `src/features`: Feature modules — auth, forum, catalog, moderation, backup, settings
- `src/lib`: GramJS client, wrappers, crypto/signing, markdown/sanitize, Dexie DB
- `src/state`: Zustand stores (session, UI, settings)
- `src/workers`: Search worker using FlexSearch
- `src/styles`: Theme and base styles
- `public`: PWA assets and icon

## Key Decisions

- Maintain a purely client-side app; hard-coded `api_id` and `api_hash` as per spec. Sessions persisted in IndexedDB; an additional localStorage mirror is kept for quick boot.
- Thread tags and manifests implemented per §6. Tags are hidden in UI and verified using HMAC if a `forumSecret` is set in Settings.
- React Router routes per §4: `/login`, `/discover`, `/forum/:id`, `/forum/:id/topic/:topicId`, `/backup`, `/settings`.
- Virtualized lists (topics and messages) for responsiveness in large threads.
- PWA configured with offline shell and image caching; auto SW updates.

## Security & Safety

- Sanitization for Markdown via `rehype-sanitize` with a tightened schema.
- Only shows KaTeX/Markdown if toggled in Settings; KaTeX uses safe rendering.
- Moderation UI stubs included; privileged actions require user to have rights (server-side enforced by Telegram).

## Next Steps

- Expand topic paging and infinite scroll.
- Improve sub-thread discovery by incremental background scans with worker.
- Media upload pipeline and thumbnails caching.
- Directory/catalouge discovery via channels.

This session will be updated as changes are made.

## Implementation Progress

- Created Vite + React + TS app, configured PWA (autoUpdate) with maskable icon and theme colors.
- Added Node polyfills for GramJS (Buffer/process/global and node: protocol imports), configured Vite aliases to match TS paths.
- Implemented global stores: session, settings, forums.
- Implemented Telegram client wrapper: `sendCode`, `signIn` (2FA capable via `GetPassword` + `checkPassword`), `resolveForum`, topic listing, topic history, and send message to a topic via `replyToTopId`.
- Implemented Markdown with GFM, KaTeX, highlight and sanitize; toggles in settings.
- Implemented thread tag parse/strip/append utilities.
- Implemented pages: Login, Discover (resolve @handle, store forum, navigate), Forum (list topics), Topic (virtualized messages, sub-thread aggregation, composer with optional tag), Backup (stub), Settings.
- Implemented UI theme: modern dark with desktop-first layout; sleek components and interactions.
- Added Workbox config to cache larger bundles and images; service worker registration with `virtual:pwa-register` typing.
- Built successfully via `npm run build` with a generated service worker and precache manifest.

## Notes

- For production, consider chunk-splitting GramJS to reduce main bundle size.
- Security: api_id/hash are hard-coded per spec; rate limiting and potential rotation should be considered externally.
- Future: implement media upload, moderation tools, search worker, and full catalogue.
